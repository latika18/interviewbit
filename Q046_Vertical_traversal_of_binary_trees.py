Given a binary tree, print a vertical order traversal of it.

Example :
Given binary tree:

      6
    /   \
   3     7
  / \     \
 2   5     9
returns

[
    [2],
    [3],
    [6 5],
    [7],
    [9]
]


Note : If 2 Tree Nodes shares the same vertical level then the one with lesser depth will come first.
